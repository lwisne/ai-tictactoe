# Example Walkthrough: Implementing a Feature with Multi-Agent System

This walkthrough demonstrates the complete process of implementing a feature using the 7-agent system. We'll implement **win and draw detection** for the Tic-Tac-Toe game, showing each agent's involvement, artifacts created, and expected outputs.

## Feature: Win and Draw Detection (LWI-71)

**Goal:** Automatically detect when a player has won or when the game has ended in a draw, and display appropriate UI feedback.

## Phase 1: Requirements Definition with Product Manager

### User Invocation

```
User: I want to implement win and draw detection for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
      We need to check after each move whether someone has won or if
      the board is full with no winner.
```

### Agent: Product Manager (PRD)

The Product Manager agent activates to validate or create requirements.

**Expected Interaction:**

```
Product Manager: I'll review the PRD to validate what's required for
win and draw detection. Let me check the Tic-Tac-Toe PRD.

[Agent fetches PRD.md using Notion MCP or local file]

Based on the PRD, win and draw detection requires:

Requirements from PRD Section 3.1:
✓ Win Detection: Automatic detection of winning combinations
  - All horizontal rows (3)
  - All vertical columns (3)
  - Both diagonals (2)
  - Total: 8 possible winning combinations

✓ Draw Detection: Recognize when game ends in draw
  - All 9 cells filled
  - No winning combination exists

✓ Visual Feedback (Section 4.3):
  - Show win/draw banner within 300ms
  - Display winner (X or O) or "Draw" message
  - Present Restart and Home CTAs

✓ User Flow (Section 4.1, Flow 3):
  - No further moves allowed after end-state
  - Result persisted to game history
  - Haptic feedback on game end

Acceptance Criteria:
1. All 8 winning combinations correctly identified
2. Draw detected only when board full and no winner
3. Game state prevents moves after end-state detected
4. UI banner appears within 300ms performance requirement
5. Haptic feedback triggers on game end
6. Result saved to history with mode, difficulty, timestamp

This is well-defined in the PRD. Ready to proceed with implementation.
```

**Artifacts Created:**
- Extracted requirements checklist
- Identified PRD sections: 3.1, 4.1 (Flow 3), 4.3

---

## Phase 2: Architecture Review with Architecture Guardian

### User/System Invocation

```
User: Before we start implementing, let's review the architectural
      requirements for this feature.
```

### Agent: Architecture Guardian

**Expected Interaction:**

```
Architecture Guardian: I'll review the architectural requirements
for win/draw detection against our documented patterns in
technical-architecture.md.

[Agent reads technical-architecture.md]

Architectural Requirements:

1. Game Logic Layer (Section 4.2 - Business Logic):
   - Implement win detection in GameLogic service class
   - Keep UI layer (widgets) separate from game rules
   - Pure functions for win/draw checking (no side effects)

2. State Management (Section 5.1 - State Architecture):
   - GameState should include `GameStatus` enum
   - Values: inProgress, playerXWon, playerOWon, draw
   - Use GameCubit to manage state transitions
   - Emit new state when game ends

3. Performance Requirements (Section 8.1):
   - Win detection must complete in < 1ms
   - Use O(1) lookup for win patterns, not O(n²) search
   - Recommended: Pre-defined winning position sets

4. Testing Requirements (Section 9.2):
   - Unit tests for all 8 win combinations
   - Unit tests for draw scenarios
   - Edge case: Last move is winning move
   - Integration test: Full game to win
   - Integration test: Full game to draw

Implementation Pattern:
\`\`\`dart
// lib/game/logic/game_logic.dart
class GameLogic {
  static const List<List<int>> winPatterns = [
    [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], // rows
    [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], // columns
    [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]              // diagonals
  ];

  GameStatus checkGameStatus(List<String?> board) {
    // Check wins, then check draw, return status
  }
}
\`\`\`

Architectural Standards to Follow:
- Separation: Logic in lib/game/logic/, UI in lib/game/widgets/
- Immutability: Return new GameState, don't mutate existing
- Testing: lib/game/logic/game_logic_test.dart for unit tests
- Performance: Use constant-time win pattern lookup

No architectural concerns. This feature aligns with our existing patterns.
```

**Artifacts Created:**
- Architecture requirements document
- Code pattern examples
- File organization guidance
- Performance constraints identified

---

## Phase 3: UX Review with UX Design Reviewer

### User/System Invocation

```
User: Let's also review the UX requirements for how we present
      win and draw states to users.
```

### Agent: UX Design Reviewer

**Expected Interaction:**

```
UX Design Reviewer: I'll review the UX requirements for the end-game
experience based on PRD Section 4.1 (Flow 3) and Section 4.3 (Mockups).

UX Requirements Analysis:

1. Visual Feedback (Critical):
   - Banner overlay appears on top of game board
   - Large, clear text: "X Wins!", "O Wins!", or "Draw!"
   - Prominent CTA buttons: [Restart] [Home]
   - Banner should be dismissible only via CTAs, not tapping outside

2. Performance (Critical):
   - Banner appears within 300ms of win/draw detection
   - Animation should enhance, not delay feedback
   - Suggestion: Fade-in animation (200ms) with slight scale

3. Accessibility (High Priority):
   - Semantic label for screen readers: "Game ended. X wins."
   - Focus automatically moves to Restart button
   - High contrast for banner (ensure WCAG AA compliance)
   - Touch targets for buttons: minimum 44x44 dp

4. Interaction States (High Priority):
   - Disable board interaction after game ends
   - Visual indicator: Dim/desaturate board cells
   - Winning cells could be highlighted (optional enhancement)
   - Haptic feedback: Light impact on win, notification on draw

5. Error Prevention (Medium Priority):
   - Confirm restart if game just ended? (per settings)
   - Default: No confirmation, quick restart
   - Consideration: Prevent accidental taps during banner animation

User Flow Validation:
✓ Step 1-2: Game continues until win/draw → Clear
✓ Step 3: Banner appears with result → Clear
✓ Step 4: CTAs presented → Clear
✓ Step 5: Restart maintains mode → Clear
✓ Step 6: Home returns to menu → Clear

Mockup Reference (Section 4.3):
\`\`\`
+--------------------+
|  X Wins!           |
|  [ Restart ] [Home]|
+--------------------+
\`\`\`

Recommendations:
1. Use Material 3 dialog or custom overlay widget
2. Position centered vertically, full width with padding
3. Primary action: Restart (filled button)
4. Secondary action: Home (outlined button)
5. Include subtle celebration animation for wins
6. Keep draw messaging neutral, not negative

UX Coherence: ✓ Approved
The PRD provides clear, user-centered guidance for this feature.
```

**Artifacts Created:**
- UX requirements checklist
- Accessibility guidelines
- Animation specifications
- Component recommendations

/// Core game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe
/// Handles win detection, draw detection, and game state validation
class GameLogic {
  /// All possible winning combinations in a Tic-Tac-Toe board
  /// Indexed 0-8 from top-left to bottom-right
  static const List<List<int>> winPatterns = [
    // Horizontal rows
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    // Vertical columns
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    // Diagonals
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6],
  ];

  /// Checks if the given player has won
  ///
  /// [board] - Current board state (9 positions)
  /// [player] - Player mark to check ('X' or 'O')
  ///
  /// Returns true if player has a winning combination
  static bool checkWin(List<String?> board, String player) {
    assert(board.length == 9, 'Board must have exactly 9 positions');
    assert(player == 'X' || player == 'O', 'Player must be X or O');

    return winPatterns.any((pattern) {
      return pattern.every((index) => board[index] == player);
    });
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Key Learnings

1. **Early Planning Pays Off:** Time spent in requirements and architecture review prevented rework during implementation

2. **Incremental Quality Gates:** Catching issues at each sub-task prevented accumulation of technical debt

3. **Agent Specialization:** Each agent's focused expertise ensured thorough coverage of their domain

4. **Automated Coordination:** Agents handed off work naturally, reducing manual coordination overhead

5. **Living Documentation:** Architecture and testing standards were referenced throughout, keeping them current

## How to Replicate This Process

For your own features:

1. **Start with Natural Language:** Describe what you want to build
2. **Let Product Manager Extract Requirements:** From PRD or create new ones
3. **Get Architecture Guidance:** Before coding, understand patterns
4. **Break Down Incrementally:** Smaller tasks = better quality control
5. **Implement with Standards:** Follow your project's architecture
6. **Test Continuously:** Verify coverage after each implementation
7. **Review Thoroughly:** Technical review catches what tests miss
8. **Validate Against Requirements:** Ensure PRD is fully satisfied

The multi-agent system automates and coordinates these steps, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
