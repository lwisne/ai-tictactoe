## 3. Gap Analysis

### ⚠️ MINOR GAPS IDENTIFIED

#### 3.1 Home Screen Score Display Toggle
**PRD Reference:** Section 4.0.2 "Session Stats Presentation"

**Gap:**
- PRD specifies: "Stats collapsed by default with toggle: 'Show Stats' / 'Hide Stats'"
- Linear tasks cover session stats tracking and display
- **Missing:** Explicit task for collapsible stats toggle UI implementation

**Impact:** LOW - Implementation straightforward, part of home screen UI

**Recommendation:** Add task under Epic 3 or Epic 8:
```
LWI-XXX: Implement collapsible session stats toggle on home screen
- Default state: collapsed ("Show Stats" button)
- Toggle expands/collapses stats section
- Only shows modes played in current session
- Empty state hidden when no games played
```

---

#### 3.2 AI Difficulty Selection - "Recommended" Badge
**PRD Reference:** Section 4.2A.2 "Difficulty Descriptions"

**Gap:**
- PRD specifies Medium difficulty should have a "Recommended" badge
- Epic 4 tasks mention difficulty selection but don't explicitly call out badge requirement

**Impact:** LOW - Visual polish, not functional

**Recommendation:** Verify in implementation or add subtask:
```
- Medium difficulty displays "Recommended" badge (accent color)
- Badge positioned to right of "Medium" title
- Semantic label: "Recommended difficulty level"
```

---

#### 3.3 Winning Line Highlight Animation
**PRD Reference:** Section 4.0.2 "Modal Win/Draw Banner", Section 4.3 Mockups

**Gap:**
- PRD specifies: "Winning line highlighted on board behind banner (accent color, 4dp stroke)"
- PRD also mentions: "Winning line highlight animation (draw line through winning cells)" in LWI-140
- **Ambiguity:** Should this be a static highlight or animated line draw?

**Impact:** LOW - Visual polish enhancement

**Recommendation:** Clarify specification:
- If static highlight: Add to LWI-103 (Win/draw modal banners)
- If animated line: Included in LWI-140 (Celebration animations)
- PRD suggests both: highlight cells + draw line animation

---

#### 3.4 Mid-Game Settings Access Without Losing State
**PRD Reference:** Section 4.1 Flow 2 "Mid-Game Settings Adjustments"

**Gap:**
- PRD explicitly requires: "Board state and turn persist unchanged when opening or closing Settings"
- Settings epic (LWI-91) focuses on settings functionality but doesn't explicitly test mid-game access

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Important UX requirement

**Recommendation:** Add to LWI-136 (Integration tests):
```
Integration test scenario:
1. Start game, make 3-4 moves
2. Open settings mid-game
3. Change theme and sound
4. Close settings
5. Verify: board state unchanged, turn preserved, game continues
```

---

#### 3.5 App Lifecycle State Preservation
**PRD Reference:** Section 5.3 "Edge Cases and Error Handling - App Lifecycle"

**Gap:**
- PRD requires: "Mid-game interruption (app killed/backgrounded): Automatically save game state. On relaunch, offer to resume or start new."
- No explicit task for game state persistence across app restarts

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Important edge case for UX

**Recommendation:** Add task to Epic 2 or Epic 8:
```
LWI-XXX: Implement mid-game state persistence
- Save board state, turn, mode, difficulty on app pause/kill
- Load saved state on app relaunch
- Show dialog: "Resume game?" or "Start new game?"
- Clear saved state after resume or explicit new game
- Handle corrupted state gracefully
```

---

#### 3.6 Rapid Tap Debouncing
**PRD Reference:** Section 5.3 "Edge Cases - Input Validation - Rapid tapping"

**Gap:**
- PRD specifies: "Debounce cell taps with 100ms cooldown. Ignore duplicate or rapid taps during cooldown."
- Error handling epic (LWI-143) covers general input validation
- **Missing:** Explicit debouncing implementation detail

**Impact:** LOW - Implementation detail, likely handled naturally

**Recommendation:** Verify in implementation or add to LWI-143:
```
- Add 100ms debounce to cell tap handlers
- Prevent duplicate taps during AI turn (board disabled)
- Test rapid tapping scenarios
```

---

#### 3.7 Storage Full and Corrupted Data Handling
**PRD Reference:** Section 5.3 "Edge Cases - Storage Issues"

**Gap:**
- LWI-143 (Error handling) mentions storage errors but not specific PRD requirements:
  - "Storage full: Display user-friendly error message"
  - "Corrupted storage: Clear corrupted data with one-time message"
- Needs explicit acceptance criteria match

**Impact:** LOW - Edge case, covered at high level

**Recommendation:** Enhance LWI-143 acceptance criteria:
```
- Storage full: Non-blocking toast with clear message
- Corrupted preferences: Reset to defaults with one-time banner
- Corrupted history: Clear history with recovery notice
- Test programmatically with mock storage failures
```

---

#### 3.8 Optional Pulse Animation for Turn Indicator
**PRD Reference:** Section 4.0.2 "Prominent Turn Indication"

**Gap:**
- PRD mentions: "Optional pulse animation on turn change"
- LWI-105 (Turn indicator) doesn't specify animation
- LWI-140 (Animations) may cover this

**Impact:** VERY LOW - Optional polish

**Recommendation:** Clarify if this is in scope for MVP or Future Enhancements

---

### ✅ NON-ISSUES (Intentionally Deferred or Optional)

#### Sound Effects Implementation
- **Status:** LWI-141 marked as "optional"
- **PRD Status:** Section 5.1 lists audioplayers as "optional, simple SFX"
- **Assessment:** ✅ Correctly prioritized as optional

#### Advanced Filtering Edge Cases
- PRD mentions filter state persistence across navigation
- Covered in LWI-121 acceptance criteria
- ✅ No gap

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- PRD Section 5.1: "CI/CD (Nice-to-have)"
- Not in Linear tasks
- ✅ Correctly deferred as non-MVP

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Risks from PRD Section 10

#### Risk 1: Hard AI exceeds time budget
- **Linear Coverage:** Epic 4 includes performance optimization tasks
- **Mitigation:** Isolates, alpha-beta pruning, memoization, fallback
- **Status:** ✅ ADDRESSED

#### Risk 2: Corrupted or full storage
- **Linear Coverage:** LWI-143 (error handling), LWI-119 (persistence)
- **Mitigation:** Validation, try-catch, auto-prune to 1000 entries
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (needs explicit user messaging)

#### Risk 3: Accessibility regressions
- **Linear Coverage:** LWI-137 (accessibility testing)
- **Mitigation:** TalkBack/VoiceOver testing, contrast checks, semantic labels
- **Status:** ✅ ADDRESSED

#### Risk 4: Input edge cases
- **Linear Coverage:** LWI-143 (error handling), LWI-100 (turn management)
- **Mitigation:** Debounce, board disable during AI turn, validation
- **Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS EXPLICIT DEBOUNCE VERIFICATION (Gap 3.6)

#### Risk 5: Scope creep
- **Linear Coverage:** Well-defined epics with clear scope boundaries
- **Mitigation:** Future Enhancements deferred (online multiplayer, achievements)
- **Status:** ✅ ADDRESSED

---

## 7. Missing Features Not in PRD or Linear

**Assessment:** None identified. All Linear tasks map to PRD requirements, and all PRD requirements are covered by Linear tasks (with minor gaps noted in Section 3).

---

## 8. Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Additions (Before Development Starts)
