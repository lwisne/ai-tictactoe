# Tic-Tac-Toe Flutter App

A fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Flutter, featuring AI opponents with multiple difficulty levels.

## 🎮 Features

### Core Gameplay
- **3×3 Game Board**: Classic tic-tac-toe grid with smooth animations
- **Win Detection**: Automatic detection of all winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals)
- **Draw Detection**: Recognizes when the game ends in a draw
- **Restart Functionality**: Quick reset to play again

### Game Modes
- **Two Player Mode**: Play locally with a friend
- **Single Player Mode**: Challenge the AI with three difficulty levels:
  - **Easy**: Random moves - perfect for beginners
  - **Medium**: Blocks obvious winning moves - moderate challenge
  - **Hard**: Minimax algorithm - nearly unbeatable optimal play

### Technical Highlights
- **State Management**: BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc
- **Navigation**: go_router for declarative routing
- **Theming**: Material 3 with automatic light/dark mode support
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for game pieces and board states
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration on moves and game completion
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## 🤖 AI Implementation

The AI opponent uses different strategies based on difficulty:

### Easy
- Makes random valid moves
- Great for beginners

### Medium
- Looks for immediate winning moves
- Blocks opponent's winning moves
- Falls back to random moves otherwise

### Hard
- Implements minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Evaluates all possible game states
- Makes optimal moves every time
- Prioritizes faster wins and slower losses

## 🎨 Design

- **Material 3 Design System**: Modern, accessible UI components
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Light/Dark Themes**: Respects system theme preferences
- **Smooth Animations**: Scale transitions for game pieces
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded players (X in primary color, O in secondary)

## 📝 Generation Story

This app was generated entirely by Claude Code from a single PRD (Product Requirements Document) stored in Notion.

### Prompts Used

1. **Initial Request**: "Can you see the Tic Tac Toe PRD in my notion"
   - Claude retrieved and displayed the complete PRD from Notion

2. **Implementation Request**: "great - can you build this"
   - Claude created a complete implementation plan
   - Built the entire Flutter application from scratch

3. **Documentation Request**: "can you put in the README the prompts used to generate and the summary here?"
   - Updated README with generation details

### What Was Built

✅ **Core Features:**
- 3×3 game board with alternating turns
- Win detection for all possible winning combinations
- Draw detection
- Restart game functionality

✅ **Game Modes:**
- Two-player mode (local multiplayer)
- Single-player mode vs AI with 3 difficulty levels

✅ **Technical Implementation:**
- Flutter 3.x with Dart
- BLoC pattern (flutter_bloc) for state management
- go_router for navigation
